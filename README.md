# ðŸ¤– Chat GUI â€” Hugging Face Flan-T5 Small

A simple desktop chatbot application built with Python and Tkinter that connects to Hugging Faceâ€™s **Flan-T5 small** model for conversational AI. This project provides a lightweight graphical interface where users can type their queries and receive responses generated by the language model hosted on Hugging Faceâ€™s Inference API.

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ” Interactive GUI using Tkinter  
âœ” Uses Hugging Face's `google/flan-t5-small` model  
âœ” Displays conversation history in a scrollable window  
âœ” Supports real-time user interaction with Enter key or Send button  
âœ” Handles network and API errors gracefully  
âœ” Easy to configure with `.env` for API tokens

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

chat_gui_hf/
â”œâ”€â”€ chat_gui_hf.py # Main Python script with GUI and API interaction
â”œâ”€â”€ .env # Environment file storing the Hugging Face API token
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt # Python dependencies

###1.Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

###Contents of requirements.txt:
requests
python-dotenv

You may also need tkinter, which is usually pre-installed with Python. If not, install it via your package manager:

sudo apt install python3-tk
###3. Setup environment variables
Create a .env file in the project 
directory with the following content:
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_token_here

How It Works

The script loads your API token from the .env file.

It sends the userâ€™s input as a prompt to the Hugging Face API.

The API response is parsed and displayed in the GUI.

It handles various errors such as network issues or model loading delays.

The GUI is built with Tkinter, providing a simple chat interface.

ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Python 3.x

requests â€“ for API requests

python-dotenv â€“ for loading environment variables

tkinter â€“ for GUI development

ðŸ›  Configuration

Change the model by updating the HF_MODEL variable in chat_gui_hf.py:

HF_MODEL = "google/flan-t5-small"


Adjust parameters like max_new_tokens and temperature in the query_hf() function.

ðŸ“‚ Future Improvements

âœ” Add support for other Hugging Face models
âœ” Implement conversation memory or context handling
âœ” Improve UI design with themes and styling
âœ” Add voice input/output using speech recognition libraries
âœ” Package the app for cross-platform use
